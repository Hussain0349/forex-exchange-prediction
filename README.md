This project uses historical Forex exchange rate data to train a regression model that predicts future currency values. Ideal for beginners exploring regression techniques in financial contexts.# Forex Exchange Rate Regression Model

This project demonstrates how to train a regression model on Forex exchange rate data to predict future currency values based on historical trends.

## 📂 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes:
- **Date**: Record of the exchange rate day
- **Exchange Rate**: Value of a currency at that point in time

## 📊 Objective
Train a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression) to predict the next exchange rate value based on past data.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)
- Matplotlib (Visualization)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Load the CSV dataset
2. Preprocess (convert dates, scale if necessary)
3. Split into training and testing sets
4. Train a regression model
5. Visualize predictions vs actual values

## ✅ Use Cases
- Currency value forecasting
- Time series regression examples
- Financial analytics for learners
